# ImageAsyncLoader
It is a Image Async Loader library, you can load local image file or download online image with url.

# dependencies
I use "Cube ImageLoader" as a base project, use Volley as a HTTP request framework.

# functions
1.load local image file asynchronously <br/>
2.load network image with url asynchronously. <br/>
(It's easy to learn how to build a minimum async-image-loader framework/library in this project,
and it's not so robust and extensible, and I'll fix bugs in my spare time)
